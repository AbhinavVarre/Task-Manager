A simple task manager in React Native, with a third party state management system (MobX)

To run the app, please go to the home directory of the project and follow these steps: 

1. Create a .env file past the configuration details that are used in in the firebaseConfig file 
2. Run npm i
3. Run npx expo start
4. Run the iOS simulator (I checked my UI on an iPhone 15 simulator)
5. If there are any issues with icons or anything else loading, please run the npx expo run:ios and open the xcworkspace directory in xCode - there might be some issue with signing or something of the sort
